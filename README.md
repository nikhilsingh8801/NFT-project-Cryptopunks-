# NFT Project ( Cryptopunks )

## Instruction
Over the past 18 months, an emerging technology has caught
the attention of the world; the NFT. What is an NFT? They are
digital assets stored on the blockchain. And over $22 billion
was spent last year on purchasing NFTs. Why? People enjoyed
the art, the speculated on what they might be worth in the
future, and people didn’t want to miss out.

The future of NFT’s is unclear as much of the NFT’s turned out
to be scams of sorts since the eld is wildly unregulated.
They’re also contested heavily for their impact on the
environment.

Regardless of these controversies, it is clear that there is
money to be made in NFT’s. And one cool part about NFT’s is
that all of the data is recorded on the blockchain, meaning
anytime something happens to an NFT, it is logged in this
database.

In this project, you’ll be tasked to analyze real-world NFT
data.

That data set is a sales data set of one of the most famous
NFT projects, Cryptopunks. Meaning each row of the data set
represents a sale of an NFT. The data includes sales from
January 1st, 2018 to December 31st, 2021. 
The table hasseveral columns including the buyer address, the ETH price,
the price in U.S. dollars, the seller’s address, the date, the
time, the NFT ID, the transaction hash, and the NFT name.

space, but you should be able to infer enough to answer the
